# Kutoro: Freedom in a Token
A token running on the BEP-20 Network. We're one of the first tokens that don't take half of the supply for ourselves. We're very community orriented. Kutoro isnt a token, its a home! Kutoro will be not just a token, but an entire world. With votes counted by how many coins you have, it allows people who are really involved in the community to have a say. Voters will have their coins used to vote locked and delegated on until the election is over. With Kutoro, the actual community gets to decide if we mint or if we burn, and other crutial information so that it will only benifit the actual community. Unlike other blatent cashgrabs, Kutoro will have NO ADDED FEES. Some coins have token fees up to even 10% per transfer. The community can agree to set a token fee if they choose but the proceeds are locked to either a burn address or to a charity of the community's choosing. Kuroto also airdrops to all holders when the community votes too, but also does it on Christmas regardless. Wanna just try Kutoro? We have a faucet function, entirely controlled by the community... all you have to do is pay the contract interaction gas fees. **Kutoro! Freedom in a Coin!**
